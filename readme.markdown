# Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode guide dataset

I couldn't find a list like this anywhere, so why not? Movie titles are pulled
from complete series torrent; shorts from [Satellite News episode guide][sneq].
This list doesn't include the [1996 movie][mst3ktm].

## example

```json
{
  "id": "S06E21",
  "season": 6,
  "episode": 21,
  "movie": "The Beast Of Yucca Flats",
  "shorts": ["Money Talks!", "Progress Island, U.S.A."]
}
```
